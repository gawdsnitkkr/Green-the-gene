<p data-img="images/initiatives/aqua.jpg" data-h="The Aqua Revival: How we recycle 850,000 liters of water every year !">
The Aqua Revival, despite of being extremely simple, is a very unique and innovative way to address one of the major problems of the Haryana Region of India scarcity of water. And over the past three years has recycled over 2.5 Million liters of water. As our region is one of those which receives no more than 50 cm of rainfall in a year, making a lot of people suffer from water scarcity, this project has been a boon to many. 
<br/>In this project we are recycling over 850,000 litres of waste swimming pool and RO Water every year, since the past three years.

<p data-img="images/initiatives/wake.jpg" data-h="Wake up Call - India">
The Wake Up Call is a peaceful, global action for positive change that took place on the 21st of February 2012 (21.2.12). It seeked to create simultaneous action in over 120 countries under the same message: “this is a Wake Up Call” 
<br/>
The Wake Up Call is a call from ordinary people all over the world to governments, corporations, communities and individuals. It aims to attract global attention towards the Wake Up Call message by involving a critical mass of people across the globe. It also aims to empower people who participate in the Wake Up Call to believe that through widespread collaborative global action, ordinary people can exercise meaningful power over important global decisions.

<p data-img="images/initiatives/nomoreplastic.jpg" data-h="No more plastic-Time to Change !">
We held rallies and demonstrations, and held parallel campaigns in Delhi, India and Nairobi, Kenya. Green the Gene achieved a tremendous amount of help and support from the shop owners, sales people, consumers, and even the government. 
<br/>
What we accomplished: 
<br/>
These efforts bore fruit and after days of relentless campaigning, petitioning, writing letters, here is an important Victory, due to the continued hard work of Green the Geners and volunteers across Haryana, India whose continuous hard work and efforts got the supermarket chain "SRS Value Bazaar" to put a complete stop on using plastic bags for groceries ! That is 19 stores not using plastic, but an innovative alternative.

<p data-img="images/initiatives/lifeisgreen.jpg" data-h="Life is Green Campaign: Gambia pledges to plant 1.5 million trees - 1 for Every Gambian Citizen">
This ongoing campaign initiated in The Gambia, a west African country, by Green the Gene's representative Fatoumatta Bah encourages people to recycle things that we all tend to just throw away usually and along with that - plant trees. 
<br/>
Here, Green the Gene in collaboration with the UNEP Billion Tree Campaign has collected pledges for the planting of 1.5 million trees, 1 for every Gambian citizen. 
<br/>
The idea of planting trees is reaching out to the people along with support and encouragement of the Government of Gambia, a lot of the pledges have materialized and a lot more are happening.
